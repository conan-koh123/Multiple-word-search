# Multiple word search
A python program, written in Python 2.7, which I have created to highlight important words in clinical history of patients. Various colours (red and blue) are used to highlight different groups of words, such as clinical symptoms and medical history/ family history. The groups of words are pre-defined in the program. This program is used to improve the efficiency of data extraction from clinical history, which is difficult to do so automatically as there are too many abbreviations used in these clinical history. 

For "Multiple word search_Upper GI.py" python file, it was used by me to aid in my data collection of patient with Upper GI cancer, such as whether clinical symptoms (e.g. dysphagia) is presented and the medical/family history of patients. Highlight of relevant words will only appear when any keyboard key (e.g. Down key) is pressed after pasting the relevant text into the programme. 

For "multiple word search for clinical history_v1.py" python file, it is improved with the addition of buttons allowing either clinical history or medical/family history to be highlighted. In addition, the program allows resetting of highlighter and removal of clinical history with buttons  (Screenshot attached below). For this program, a sample of clinical history (clinical history sample.txt) is attached here to test the functionality of the program.
