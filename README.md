# Multiple word search
A python programme that highlight the relevant words in red or blue colour

In this example, it is programmed to highlight important words for clinical history of patients with GI cancer, such as dysphagia, LOW (Loss of weight). The different colours (red and blue) are used to differentiate different groups of words, such as clinical symptoms and medical history/ family history. The programme is used to improve the efficiency of data extraction from clinical history, which is difficult to do so automatically as there are too many abbreviations used in these clinical history.
